CATH_Domain_names - SuperFamily description for CATH-4.3 HMMs

covid_up_4.3_notc.crh - cath-resolve-hits output.  were performed against 4.3 HMMs without inclusion-threshold filtering

covid_up_4.3_notc.html - cath-resolve-hits HTML output. Confidence of hit is color-coded based on bitscore

covid_uniprot_4.3_filtered_tc.crh - Reduced HMMs set including only CATH Functional Families with High DOPS (>80) and more than 5 sequences in the HMM. In addition to the filtering, only hits passing the HMM inclusion threshold were included.
Most conservative assignment.
